# MolarMassCalc
A python program to help calculate molar mass

USAGE: When you run the program, it will ask you to enter an element or compound. Elements must be written in uppercase and compounds must follow the uppercase lowercase structure Ex: Zinc = Zn. If you need to add a subscript to your element/compound, add it after said element/compound Ex: H2 means 2 hydrogen atoms or (NH3)2 means 2 units of Ammonium (1 Nitrogen, 3 Hydrogen). Coeficients should be added before the compound with parentheses. Ex: 2(KCl).
