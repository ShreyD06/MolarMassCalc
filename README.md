# MolarMassCalc
A python program to help calculate molar mass

USAGE: When you run the program, it will ask you to enter an element or compound. Elements must be written in uppercase and compounds must follow the uppercase lowercase structure Ex: Zinc = Zn. If you need to add a subscript to your element/compound, add it after said element/compound Ex: H2 means 2 hydrogen atoms or (NH3)2 means 2 units of Ammonium (1 Nitrogen, 3 Hydrogen).

Examples:
To find the molar mass of water, enter: H2O
To find the molar mass of Sulfurous acid, enter: H2SO3

Enjoy!
